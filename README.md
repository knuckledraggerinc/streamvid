# Streaming Camera 

* This app *streams the camera and microphone of your phone to VLC using RTSP

* This app uses the libstreaming library (https://github.com/fyhertz/libstreaming) to find out how streaming is achieved in this app.**

# Features

 * The stream can be directly read by VLC player using RTSP (http://ipaddress:1234)
 
 * At this time the preferences menu is not linked to the camera control so the Resolution, bitrate, framerate and disabling sound is not functioning


******I have started to work on a different app and have given up on this approach since I am trying to record video locally onto the android device******

****** I am currently working with the android NDK to try and accomplish this and will add to a repository shortly once I get a somewhat working streaming app******
